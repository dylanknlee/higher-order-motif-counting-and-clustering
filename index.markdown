# Introduction: What are Networks and Motifs?

_**Networks**_ are a data structure widely popular across all scientific domains to visualize and represent interconnected systems of data. 
Whether it be linked neurons synapsing in the brain, users who follow each other on social media, or cities linked by flights, networks
have been increasingly useful to analyze and deepen our understanding of the relationships between virtually all facets of our everyday life!

While we often regard networks to be built upon nodes joined together by edges, we may find it useful to look at smaller subgraphs instead.
Rather than considering individual nodes to be the primary unit of analysis, we focused on substructures known as _**motifs**_, which for our 
project specifically, are triangular patterns between three separate nodes linked by edges which vary in number and direction.

Shown below is a collection of all the observed motifs analyzed for this project:

_But why would we want to utilize motifs instead of nodes?_
